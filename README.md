# Image to WhiteBoard Sketch Video Generation
Let's use Python with NumPy & Cv2 to generate this videos. This do not require any fancy pre-trained AI models. This one uses NumPy and OpenCV to do the job.

# Demo
To be added later

## ⚒️ Manual Installation

### Download the Codes
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daslearning-org/ai-img2sketch.git
cd ai-img2sketch
```

## 📝 Next Plan
* Users can manually change the required video resolution (current one does the best by taking the most suitable resolution for a given image).

## 🚀 Future Plan
Make this project more powerful and include some of the components like
* [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/), the NumPy alternative with GPU support
* [CV-CUDA](https://github.com/CVCUDA/CV-CUDA), the OpenCV with GPU

## 🙏🏻 Acknowledgements
* I would like to thank [Yogendra Yatnalkar](https://github.com/yogendra-yatnalkar/storyboard-ai) for solving the complex math and sharing the python code.
